this screen plugin needs feedparser supports.

You can **easy_install feedparser** to your system.

And add the following codes to the root urls.py:

if "screens.trac_feeds" in settings.INSTALLED_APPS:
    urlpatterns += patterns('',
        (r'trac_feeds/', include("screens.trac_feeds.urls")),
    )
